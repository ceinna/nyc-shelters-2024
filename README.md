This repository displays my final Python Coding for Public Policy(PADM-GP 4506) project, which I took in the Spring 2024 semester at NYU Wagner. It includes Python analysis and a write-up that explains my thought process and the steps I took to arrive at my conclusion. I used Binder to share my analysis, tables, and plots. The site can be accessed by clicking the button above.
